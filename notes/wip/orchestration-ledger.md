# Orchestration ledger

This append-oriented log preserves work state across task compaction and agent handoff. It is operational memory, not adopted policy.

## 2026-08-01 — autonomous build opened

### Mandate

Populate the GitHub repository through reviewable pull requests with the Museum mission and governance, adopted decisions, donation and accession policy, approved donation collections, Keys and Gates program/outcomes, the actual seven-work Casey Reas donation accession, transparent NextGen-compatible generative trait analysis, documentation-as-code controls, and the contract specification that will migrate repository records on-chain.

### User-confirmed status

- Keys and Gates works have not been minted.
- Minting may use a separate 6529Stream instance or a subcollection on the main Stream contract; this is TBD.
- The Casey Reas collection has been donated and requires accession documentation.
- The future contract specification must cover migration of the governed GitHub information on-chain.

### Non-negotiable controls

- Do not infer accession from custody or transfer.
- Do not infer acquisition or minting from selection.
- Do not use OpenSea rarity metrics.
- Separate constructor and reviewer roles.
- Preserve primary evidence, observation time, uncertainty, amendments, and deterministic hashes.
- Keep sensitive donor/legal/custody material outside the public repository; publish safe summaries and hashes only.

### Active phase

Phase 1: foundation, governance, decisions, donation policy, and approved-collection register.

### Research tracks launched

Independent parallel tracks cover museum standards, Casey on-chain provenance, Casey art/technical history, NextGen rarity, Keys and Gates evidence, repository/CI architecture, governance evidence, and the external registry. Results are to be written under `notes/research/` and then reviewed before promotion.

The user clarified that Luna work must run as parallel Codex tasks rather than subagents. Seven `gpt-5.6-luna`/`xhigh` worktree tasks were therefore launched:

- Casey token verification: `019fbdd6-6e75-7043-b510-0d6e426b8c2b`
- Casey art/technical research: `019fbdd6-6e75-7043-b510-0d8f523e4493`
- Keys and Gates records: `019fbdd6-8eb7-7663-8f51-2fd0e33e9f6c`
- NextGen rarity tooling: `019fbdd6-9ac1-7e81-b331-310ad99e7c90`
- Documentation control plane: `019fbdd6-ab7a-7470-9c87-5cff139d90a8`
- On-chain migration specification: `019fbdd6-bba5-7470-b827-726e5db08bdb`
- Governance evidence review: `019fbdd6-d7a2-7680-a454-0574d2df96c5`

Terra subagents are reserved for bounded independent review and disjoint sidecar work.

### GitHub control state

- `@6529-Collections/6529seize-maintainers` was granted `maintain` access.
- Repository-wide `CODEOWNERS` and a Museum review template were added.
- Squash-only merges and automatic deletion of merged branches were configured.
- GitHub Free did not expose branch protection/rulesets while this organization repository was private; the initial 403 limitation and intended rules were recorded before visibility changed.

The repository was subsequently made public with owner authorization. Rulesets `20188741`, `20188742`, and `20188743` now enforce maintainer review semantics, no-bypass Museum CI, and Copilot review respectively. The `6529bot` GitHub App installation `140321060` covers all organization repositories; the Museum review profile passed its repository-config and limited-initial readiness validators.

Independent foundation review identified missing schemas, incomplete public-evidence admission scanning, unenforced constructor/reviewer separation, two overstated GitHub-rule claims, and an accession-conflating README heading. The working branch now contains bootstrap schemas, schema-subset validation, direct derivation of all governance facts/hashes from the authenticated proposal snapshot, raw-evidence secret admission checks, record controls, corrected GitHub wording, and a donation/accession-neutral heading. Source-derived validation also caught and corrected the Complaint Cards proposal author from `punk6529` to `blocknoob`.

The first reviewer correctly refused to bind approval because it shared the constructor task identity and found that an anonymous review object could pass. Schemas and CI now require reviewer `actor_id`, `reviewed_at`, role, approved outcome, and canonical payload SHA-256, with a hard constructor/reviewer identity inequality. Binding approval is delegated to a genuinely separate Codex task.

Separate Luna task `019fbdd6-8eb7-7663-8f51-2fd0e33e9f6c` independently approved all three payloads at 2026-08-01T15:42:12.081Z against commit `63eb40c39644559ab435b7fd8a2d75f9a6c30204`. Its payload hashes are now bound in each `record_control`; CI recomputes them and rejects self-review, anonymous review, missing immutable commit, non-approved outcome, or payload drift.

## 2026-08-01 — foundation merged and parallel build checkpoint

PR [#5](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/5) merged at 2026-08-01T15:44:14Z as `82e9069f5e8666b84ed14fdc4d04ee64b39b6bc1`. It established the public repository, active GitHub rulesets, no-bypass `Museum validation`, full Museum Wave evidence snapshot, adopted donation policy, independently reviewed governance/approved-collection/Casey-receipt registers, source-derived validation, and durable review controls.

### Active pull requests

| PR | Constructor scope | Review state at checkpoint |
|---|---|---|
| [#1](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/1) | Complete governance evidence note and append-only decision format | Bot review found only terminology/versioning consistency fixes; constructor updating from main |
| [#2](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/2) | Implementation-grade on-chain migration contract specification | Bot review found hash/signature/inline-payload/vector ambiguities; constructor resolving before merge |
| [#3](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/3) | Casey Reas art-historical and technical research | Bot review passed with three factual-consistency clarifications requested |
| [#4](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/4) | Transparent NextGen-compatible trait analysis tooling | Bot review requires narrower OpenSea-metric rejection, defensive guards, deterministic boundaries, and additional tests |
| [#6](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/6) | Keys and Gates program plus sixteen selected-unminted records | Updating from main; program schemas and constructor controls required by new CI |
| [#7](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/7) | Full documentation-as-code control plane, manifests, schemas, tests, and CI | Updating from main while preserving required check name and foundation controls |
| [#8](https://github.com/6529-Collections/6529networkmuseum/pull/8) | Born-digital accession/donation templates and standards crosswalk | Updating from main and aligning with executable review controls |

### Next construction tracks

- The chain-verification Luna task is pivoting to the complete Casey accession dossier under `records/accessions/6529NM.2026.001/`; it must not duplicate the evidence note already on main.
- After rarity PR #4 is reviewed and merged, freeze complete project metadata snapshots and publish NextGen-compatible trait results for every generative collection represented in the Casey accession. Trait prevalence remains separate from curatorial significance.
- Keys and Gates stays `selected_unminted`. No accession or custody work begins until the Stream topology decision and actual mint evidence exist.
- Contract specification PR #2 remains non-deployed design. Implementation, audit, governance approval, and deployment are separate later gates.

### Integration order

1. Governance evidence note and standards/templates, if their rebased diffs remain independent.
2. Documentation control plane.
3. Keys and Gates records against the final schemas.
4. Reviewed rarity tooling.
5. Casey accession dossier, then full-collection trait snapshots/results.
6. Contract migration specification after all integrity and signature findings are closed.
7. Cross-disciplinary release audit and deterministic manifest.

### Known evidence anchors

- Museum Wave: `5f207393-5418-4a75-8738-e40edb44a94d`
- Keys and Gates Wave: `4ff022b3-aa17-4a0a-ba78-58f64ff1d427`
- Museum custody reference: `networkmuseum.6529.eth`
- Casey accession lot: `6529NM.2026.001`
- 6529Stream implementation pin: `5021c8060950c3fef995271e674ed4b2007fee6d`

### Next actions

1. Publish Phase 1 pull request.
2. Reconstruct all sixteen Keys and Gates records as `selected_unminted`.
3. Verify Casey token identities and transfer evidence, then build the actual accession dossier without overstating incomplete gates.
4. Implement schemas, validation, deterministic manifests, and CI.
5. Produce an implementable on-chain migration contract specification and test vectors.

## 2026-08-01 - review-bot routing checkpoint

The `6529reviewbot` source repository was audited before changing Museum review routing. Its specialist kinds are intentionally opt-in rather than part of `review all`, and `followup` is designed for commits made after initial review.

The Museum base profile now applies `general`, `security`, `privacy-evidence`, and advisory `glm-swarm` to every pull request. It allows, but does not automatically spend on, `media-external`, `stream-contracts`, and `deploy-actions`. Maintainer commands route those specialists to evidence ingest, contract, and CI/release diffs respectively. The active PR-by-PR matrix is preserved in `governance/pull-request-review-policy.md`.

Independent review rejected the first routing draft because it documented five-kind commands that the four-job delivery cap would deny, duplicated automatic synchronize-event follow-up, and assigned external-media and Stream-contract specialists to prose outside their prompt boundaries. The corrected procedure keeps the conservative four-job cap, does not repeat the automatic baseline in specialist commands, and limits each command to four or fewer specialist jobs. `media-external` is now limited to executable external ingest, and `stream-contracts` to normative contract surfaces intentionally equivalent to 6529Stream.

## 2026-08-01 - exact-head review checkpoint

Main is `9f38bd4ba5f779540eabf2dfce019cc1382561e2` at this checkpoint.

### Merged work

- PR #1 merged as `7fa982abaadbd253cb813d71e67accf089759ff2`, adding the complete governance evidence note and append-only decision format.
- PR #9 merged as `72622a670854cc489330d930136bae7318044e41`, adding the risk-based review-bot policy after an independent reviewer rejected and then approved its corrected routing.
- PR #3 merged as `9f38bd4ba5f779540eabf2dfce019cc1382561e2`, adding the Casey REAS art/technical research. Independent review caught and corrected a false Studio exception: Art Blocks V3 token-ID decoding also applies to the Ex Nihilo V3.2.4 Studio token.

### Casey accession dossier

Draft PR #10 constructs lot `6529NM.2026.001` at initial head `880203dca23d3a56ec57468a2ac12069b1776aff`. It contains the formal statement, collection interpretation, seven object records/pages, seven technical/condition reports, provenance/transaction and rights schedules, preservation manifest, public inventory, restricted-annex stub, schemas, and record controls.

Its controlled state remains `received_onchain` with accession completion `not_complete`. The user-confirmed donation and seven-token receipt are recorded; title binding, donor-authority/adverse-provenance diligence, rights bases, render/condition verification, preservation ingest/recovery, display permissions, and independent review remain explicit gates. No deed, license grant, title conclusion, or rarity result is invented.

### Independent review findings in remediation

- PR #7 control plane: enforce accession cross-field identity, reject private-network envelope URIs and duplicate JSON keys, reject self-supersession, close nested schemas, and add executable ACCESSION/RIGHTS/CONDITION event-path fixtures. Receipt, acceptance, acquisition, title passage, custody receipt, and accession must be distinct events, including off-chain/non-token paths.
- PR #8 templates: add a distinct donation-acceptance event and dates, an off-chain transfer/custody path, accurate BagIt required/optional files, a C2PA 2.4 pin, structured PREMIS/IIIF/C2PA/OCFL mappings, and an explicit no-object-authorization consequence for Keys and Gates selection. Markdown remains documentation-only until executable schemas and gates exist.
- PR #6 Keys and Gates: correct OUT-015's statement-declared consent, keep per-work price null while purchase is unverified, and preserve the three previously reviewed foundation registers byte-for-byte. All 16 identities, ranks, votes, media references, statement hashes, CC0 declarations, and `selected_unminted` boundaries otherwise matched evidence.
- PR #4 rarity: match JavaScript left-fold arithmetic exactly, preserve production row order, require one collection plus observation/source provenance, support declared zero-non-Mint-trait tokens, handle NaN/Infinity and output failures without tracebacks, and reject every third-party rarity-service metric while allowing provenance citations.
- PR #2 contract specification: independent cryptographic/protocol review is in progress; no deployment or implementation claim is permitted.

Each remediation is assigned back to its constructor. The original reviewer task will re-review the exact corrected head; constructors do not bind their own approval. Mandatory `Museum validation` remains no-bypass even when other review services are rate-limited or budget-delayed.
